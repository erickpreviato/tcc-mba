  abstract  = {"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.}

  abstract = {The increasing volume of online reviews has made the development of sentiment analysis models possible for determining customers’ opinions regarding different products and services. Until now, sentiment analysis has proven to be an effective tool for determining the overall polarity of reviews. To improve the granularity at the aspect level for a better understanding of the service or product, the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to first identify aspects and then determine the user’s opinion about them. The complexity of this task lies in the fact that the same review can present multiple aspects, each with its own polarity. Current solutions have poor performance on such data. We address this problem by proposing ATESA-BÆRT, a heterogeneous ensemble learning model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. Firstly, we divide our problem into two sub-tasks, i.e., Aspect Term Extraction and Aspect Term Sentiment Analysis. Secondly, we use the argmax multi-class classification on six transformers-based learners for each sub-task. The proposed ensemble integrates representations from pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT and BART models in order to capture diverse linguistic features. By combining these with Linear, BiLSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM models, we aim to achieve enhanced performance on the aspect-based sentiment analysis task. Initial experiments on two publicly available real-world English online review datasets prove that ATESA-BÆRT outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions while tackling the sentiment analysis many aspects problem.},

  abstract  = {Sentiment analysis and opinion mining is the field of study that analyzes people's opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from written language. It is one of the most active research areas in natural language processing and is also widely studied in data mining, Web mining, and text mining. In fact, this research has spread outside of computer science to the management sciences and social sciences due to its importance to business and society as a whole. The growing importance of sentiment analysis coincides with the growth of social media such as reviews, forum discussions, blogs, micro-blogs, Twitter, and social networks. For the first time in human history, we now have a huge volume of opinionated data recorded in digital form for analysis. Sentiment analysis systems are being applied in almost every business and social domain because opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers of our behaviors. Our beliefs and perceptions of reality, and the choices we make, are largely conditioned on how others see and evaluate the world. For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the opinions of others. This is true not only for individuals but also for organizations. This book is a comprehensive introductory and survey text. It covers all important topics and the latest developments in the field with over 400 references. It is suitable for students, researchers and practitioners who are interested in social media analysis in general and sentiment analysis in particular. Lecturers can readily use it in class for courses on natural language processing, social media analysis, text mining, and data mining. Lecture slides are also available online.},

This transfer learning approach improves the overall performance on many tasks and is highly beneficial when labeled data is scarce, making pretrained LMs valuable resources specially for languages with few annotated training examples. In this work, we train BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models for Brazilian Portuguese, which we nickname BERTimbau. We evaluate our models on three downstream NLP tasks: sentence textual similarity, recognizing textual entailment, and named entity recognition. Our models improve the state-of-the-art in all of these tasks, outperforming Multilingual BERT and confirming the effectiveness of large pretrained LMs for Portuguese. We release our models to the community hoping to provide strong baselines for future NLP research: https://github.com/neuralmind-ai/portuguese-bert.},

  abstract  = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

  abstract = {To find out what other people think has been an essential part of information-gathering behaviors. And in the case of movies, the movie reviews can provide an intricate insight into the movie and can help decide whether it is worth spending time on. However, with the growing amount of data in reviews, it is quite prudent to automate the process, saving on time. Sentiment analysis is an important field of study in machine learning that focuses on extracting information of subject from the textual reviews. The area of analysis of sentiments is related closely to natural language processing and text mining. It can successfully be used to determine the attitude of the reviewer in regard to various topics or the overall polarity of the review. In the case of movie reviews, along with giving a rating in numeric to a movie, they can enlighten us on the favorableness or the opposite of a movie quantitatively; a collection of those then gives us a comprehensive qualitative insight on different facets of the movie. Opinion mining from movie reviews can be challenging due to the fact that human language is rather complex, leading to situations where a positive word has a negative connotation and vice versa. In this study, the task of opinion mining from movie reviews has been achieved with the use of neural networks trained on the “Movie Review Database” issued by Stanford, in conjunction with two big lists of positive and negative words. The trained network managed to achieve a final accuracy of 91%.},

This transfer learning approach improves the overall performance on many tasks and is highly beneficial when labeled data is scarce, making pretrained LMs valuable resources specially for languages with few annotated training examples. In this work, we train BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models for Brazilian Portuguese, which we nickname BERTimbau. We evaluate our models on three downstream NLP tasks: sentence textual similarity, recognizing textual entailment, and named entity recognition. Our models improve the state-of-the-art in all of these tasks, outperforming Multilingual BERT and confirming the effectiveness of large pretrained LMs for Portuguese. We release our models to the community hoping to provide strong baselines for future NLP research: .},

  abstract = {Student opinions for a course are important to educators and administrators, regardless of the type of the course or the institution. Reading and manually analyzing open-ended feedback becomes infeasible for massive volumes of comments at institution level or online forums. In this paper, we collected and pre-processed a large number of course reviews publicly available online. We applied machine learning techniques with the goal to gain insight into student sentiments and topics. Specifically, we utilized current Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as word embeddings and deep neural networks, and state-of-the-art BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) and XLNet (Generalized Auto-regression Pre-training). We performed extensive experimentation to compare these techniques versus traditional approaches. This comparative study demonstrates how to apply modern machine learning approaches for sentiment polarity extraction and topic-based classification utilizing course feedback. For sentiment polarity, the top model was RoBERTa with 95.5% accuracy and 84.7% F1-macro, while for topic classification, an SVM (Support Vector Machine) was the top classifier with 79.8% accuracy and 80.6% F1-macro. We also provided an in-depth exploration of the effect of certain hyperparameters on the model performance and discussed our observations. These findings can be used by institutions and course providers as a guide for analyzing their own course feedback using NLP models towards self-evaluation and improvement.},

  abstract="With the increase in the adoption rate of machine learning algorithms in multiple sectors, the need for accurate measurement and assessment is imperative, especially when classifiers are applied to real world applications. Determining which are the most appropriate evaluation metrics to effectively assess and evaluate the performance of a binary, multi-class and multi-labelled classifier needs to be further understood. Another significant challenge impacting research is that results from models that are similar in nature cannot be adequately compared if the criteria for the measurement and evaluation of these models are not standardized. This review paper aims at highlighting the various evaluation metrics being applied in research and the non-standardization of evaluation metrics to measure the classification results of the model. Although Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score are the most applied evaluation metrics, there are certain limitations when considering these metrics in isolation. Other metrics such as ROC{\backslash}AUC and Kappa statistics have proven to provide additional insightful into the effectiveness of an algorithms adequacy and should also be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of binary, multi-class and multi-labelled classifiers. The adoption of a standardized and consistent evaluation methodology should be explored as an area of future work.",
